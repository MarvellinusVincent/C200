2. It has to be a proper python code.
3. Your logic has to be correct.
4. We didn't have unittest for this homework. We just looked at the code and saw the output of it in the terminal.

- TA Comments: For Query 7, the HAVING syntax is not needed. "SELECT Low, count(City) FROM Weather GROUP BY Low" should do the trick.
